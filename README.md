This is a game written in MMBasic for the Color Maximite 2 (CMM2)
This is the first release candidate. It is feature complete and
hopefully balanced for most players. 

It is a multiplayer game for two to four players. The goal is to survive.
You will be driving a tank in an arena and have to fight the tanks of your
opponents. If your tank get hit, you can send in the crew to repair it and
continue the fight. When your repair kits are use up the battle is over,
at least for you.

This game was inspired by old arcade machines and especially one I once
fought battles against my father when I was 10 years old. It was in an
arcade machine hall in Rimini.

Of course it has been newly interpreted and the graphics and sound is
much better than in those days.

The game can be played with a Nunchuk and with the keyboard. The controls
for the Nunchuk should be straigt forward. The keyboard setup can be
configured in the game. The setup below is only an example.

		    Nunchuk	Keyboard
    Controls	    joystick	A,W,S,D
    Fire	    Button z	Q
    Repair          Button c    E

The Colour Maximite 2 is a small self contained computer inspired by
the home computers of the early 80's such as the Tandy TRS-80,
Commodore 64 and Apple II. (https://geoffg.net/maximite.html)
